Hi, my name is Sunil Kumar
I am currently working as a Junior Software Engineer at Vkraft Software Services.

I have hands-on experience in webMethods, including developing flow steps, creating adapters, setting up JDBC connections, and working with messaging triggers, pub-sub models, transactions, and file polling. 
I have also worked extensively on data format conversions involving XML, JSON, flat files, and databases.

Additionally, I have experience with Apache Kafka, handling producers, consumers, brokers, and schema registries, and I have worked with Apache Camel K, utilizing different components and Kaoto for integrations.

I have worked on API Gateway for cloud-to-cloud and local-to-cloud integrations using ngrok, AIA for audit monitoring, Bitbucket, YAML configurations, and deployment processes.

Apart from backend development, I have full-stack experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where I built a Purchase Policy PoC with vehicle, life, and travel insurance fields. 
This involved adapter services, validations using regex, and generating policy numbers based on input conditions.

Additionally, I am AWS Certified (Cloud Practitioner) and have completed an Applied Data Science certification on Coursera.

I am always eager to explore new technologies and improve my skills in cloud computing, integrations, and software development.
